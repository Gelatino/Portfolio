        <h2 id="cause-title">The Cause</h2>
        <p id="cause-text">I want to tell the story of so many people who have big dreams but can't achieve them due to their situation. We are used to comforting movies where the main character gets everything they want. But in "Oneira," Emili's story is not just about how talented she is or how hard she works, but how she tries, even when the odds are against her. It's about luck, and being born into a difficult situation. Like Emili, thousands of people don't reach their dreams. I wanted to celebrate them and show that their stories are important and deserve to be told.</p>
